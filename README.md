# Abstract

Text-driven 3D indoor scene generation holds broad applications, ranging from gaming and smart home technologies to augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) applications. Fast and high-fidelity scene generation is paramount for ensuring user-friendly experiences. However, existing methods are characterized by lengthy generation processes or necessitate the intricate manual specification of motion parameters, which introduces inconvenience for users. Furthermore, these methods often rely on narrow-field viewpoint iterative generations, compromising global consistency and overall scene quality. To address these issues, we propose FastScene, a framework for fast and high-quality 3D scene generation, while maintaining the scene consistency. Specifically, given a text prompt, we generate a panorama and estimate its depth, since panorama encompasses information about the entire scene and exhibits explicit geometric constraints. To obtain high-quality novel views, we introduce the Coarse View Synthesis (CVS) and Progressive Novel View Inpainting (PNVI) strategies, ensuring both scene consistency and view quality. Subsequently, we utilize Multi-View Projection (MVP) to form perspective views, and apply 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for fast scene generation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate FastScene surpasses other methods in both generation speed and quality with better scene consistency. Notably, guided only by a text prompt, FastScene can generate a complete 3D scene within a mere 15 minutes, which is at least one hour faster than state-of-the-art methods, making it a paradigm for user-friendly scene generation.

# Installation

1. You can use https://github.com/ArcherFMY/SD-T2I-360PanoImage to generate a panorama based on a text.

```
git clone https://github.com/ArcherFMY/SD-T2I-360PanoImage.git
cd SD-T2I-360PanoImage
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. You can follow the environment setup guide provided by 3DGS  https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting and install the corresponding environment.

# Getting Started

## 1. Download Pre-trained Models:

We have provided corresponding pre-trained weights, which you can download:

Link：https://pan.baidu.com/s/1cabfe0FMoGJ2j4VkrywzzA 
  
Code：7777

Then, follow the settings in the `pro_inpaint.py` to place these weights in the corresponding locations.

## 2. Running

First, generate a panorama based on a text:

```
cd /path of diffusion360
python demo.py
```

Then, obtain the novel multi-view panoramas by PNVI and CVS:

```
python pro_inpaint.py
```

Then, we recommend using OpenMVG to perform MVP operations, as it integrates convenient toolkits. 

```
openMVG_sample_pano_converter -i input -o out -n n -r r
```

Then you can use the obtained perspective views to train with 3DGS!

```
cd /path of 3DGS
python convert.py -s data
python train.py -s data -m data/output -w
python render.py -m data/output
```

Specifically, you can freely control the number of viewpoints and the training termination steps, allowing you to balance between the generation speed and quality.
